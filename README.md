# T-414-ÁFLV: A Competitive Programming Course

This repository contains the course material from T-414-ÁFLV, a competitive
programming course taught at Reykjavík University, Iceland. It is a three-week
long course, with a fresh lecture and problem set each day.

Lecture slides (including LaTeX sources), the problem sets, and other
supporting material can be found in this repository, inside the respective
directories. All problems are available on the [Open
Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) online judge.

## Editions
The course has been held twice, with mostly different problem sets each time:

- [2016](https://github.com/SuprDewd/T-414-AFLV/tree/2016)
- [2014](https://github.com/SuprDewd/T-414-AFLV/tree/2014)

## Adoption
The course (material) has been adopted (and adapted) by a few external sites, including:
- Ulm University, Germany
- Universidad Mayor de San Simón, Bolivia

Do you know of a site not listed here? I would be happy to hear about it.
